Using Memory Dumps:

The "Dump memory..." button will output the values of
all memory locations that are non-zero to the Emulator
logs window. Values will be output in order, starting 
at mem[0] and continuing through mem[99].

Each value is reported as follows:

@## <value>

Memory location overrides are used so that the 
memory dump contents could be copied, pasted
back in the Instructions window, compiled and 
then run. NOTE: Non-zero values of any
memory locations used as data will be saved; 
if your code does not explicitly initialize
these values during execution, results of
running the memory dump may not match your
expectations.
